No Guarantees
The author hereby admits they have absolutely no idea what this code does. Seriously. It was written in a haze of confusion, and any semblance of functionality is purely coincidental.

No Architecture Planning
There is no grand architecture behind this code. No patterns, no structure, no roadmap. Just raw, unfiltered chaos. Proceed at your own risk.

Sleepy & Rushed Code
This code was written by someone who was incredibly sleepy and in a hurry. Expect inconsistencies, random comments, and questionable logic. The author takes no responsibility for any headaches this may cause.
